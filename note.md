if (!sidebar.is(event.target) && sidebar.has(event.target).length === 0) {
  sidebar.removeClass("open");
}
This code is used to check if the click event occurred outside the sidebar element and its children. Let's understand each part step by step:

!sidebar.is(event.target): This checks if the event.target (the element that was clicked) is not the sidebar element itself. In other words, it checks if the clicked element is not the sidebar.

sidebar.has(event.target).length === 0: This checks if the event.target (the clicked element) is not a child of the sidebar element. The .has() method checks if the sidebar contains the clicked element as one of its descendants. If it doesn't, the result of sidebar.has(event.target) will be an empty jQuery object, and its length will be 0.
